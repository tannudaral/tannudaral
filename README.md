### Hi there 👋
I am Tannu Daral, a freshman at IGDTUW studying Computer Science and Engineering. I'm a tech enthusiast who is currently learning web development, android development, and exploring the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am also a technical blogger. I also have started exploring the world of open source.
I'm really interested in learning the new technologies and innovate and empower women to become a part of the tech industry.
